# 😃 Emotion, Age, Gender, and Face Recognition
 
This project was developed as part of a **Deep Learning course project**.  
We were required to upgrade an existing system — the upgrade I made was **adding emotion detection** to a project that originally performed **age, gender, and face recognition**.

## 📌 Original Project Reference

The original base project was taken from:

🔗 [Data Flair – Age & Gender Detection](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-gender-age-detection/)  
📹 [Demo Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPtBakonno8)  

Another helpful resource that contributed to the final version of the project:

## 💡 Upgrade – Emotion Detection

The added functionality in this upgraded version is **emotion recognition**, based on a deep learning model trained on facial expressions.

### 🎯 Supported Emotions:
- Angry
- Disgusted
- Fearful
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprised
- Neutral

### 🧠 Dataset Used:
We used the **FER2013 dataset** available on Kaggle:
